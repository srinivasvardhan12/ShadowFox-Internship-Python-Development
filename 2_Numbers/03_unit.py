# 3. If you cross a 490 meter long street in 7 minutes, calculate your
# speed in meters per second. Print the answer without any decimal
# point in it. Hint: Speed = Distance / Time


distance = 490
time = 7 * 60  # 7 minutes converted to seconds
speed = int(distance / time)
print("Speed in meters per second:", speed)
